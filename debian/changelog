libertine-scope (1.3+16.10.20160616-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Use wildcard matching for allowing reading any puritine click package paths
    that have the name "puritine" anywhere in the Click package name. (LP: #1590453)

  [ Kyle Nitzsche ]
  * Replace the scope settings approach to suppress display of apps with a scope
    filter based approach. This provides a blacklist file for permanent suppression
    and filters for user suppression.
  * Provide a "Hidden X Apps" department for a place to store the apps hidden in
    the main scope view, so they can be unhidden later if desired.
  * Hide 'Help' by default for all containers. (LP: #1591511)
  * Removed Settings. (LP: #1591494)

  [ Larry Price ]
  * Refactor Query class for consistent style and extract some functionality to
    helper classes.
  * Show a message when no apps are available due to filters or no apps installed.
    (LP: #1589699)

libertine-scope (1.2+16.10.20160602.1-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Using the "unconfined" template is strongly discouraged, so use the
    "ubuntu-scope-network" template and define read_path and write_path.
  * Use the ubuntu package namespace as canonical is used for special 3rd
    party click packages.  Also use variable substitution in the manifest.json.in
    file to match what's in the CMakefile.

  [ Kyle Nitzsche ]
  * Install ini file names and .so file to be fully qualified.

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]
  * Use new icon and logo for the Libertine Scope. Also renam "Legacy
    Applications Scope" to "XApps".
